# Using Machine Learning to Detect Malicious Polyglot Images


the goal was to make a tool of machine learning  to detect a type of steganography called polyglot.
<br /> In each folder there is a stage of our project and the required information on this stage

## Projects stages
1. building XSS and CSRF attacks.
2. Creating PNG, JPG and GIF Polyglots based on Shah’s paper and it's toolkit.
3. Encoding various malicious JavaScript codes in 20,000 images taken from the CIFAR-10 dataset and
<br /> Train Decision Trees with various tree depths using multiple encoding methods.
